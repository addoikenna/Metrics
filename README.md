# Project Repository
This repository contains the projects I work on and details their implementations. Notebooks and datasets used for the projects are attached here.

## Projects Overview
### Project 1 - On Track Metrics
#### *Description*:
This project categorizes student activities based on their Engagement Levels. Engagement metrics include logging into the LMS, completing modules, and quizzes, and the frequency of these actions over the past 7 and 14 days. Students are grouped into categories based on their overall engagement level.

#### *Benefits*:

- For Students: Identifies students who are struggling and provides targeted assistance.
- For Business: Identifies students likely to churn (those who do not engage often) and helps improve retention rates by taking preventive actions.

#### *Additional Resources*:

- A PowerBI report summarizing the findings is included in PDF format for stakeholder use in decision-making.

### Project 2 - Student Badge
#### *Description*:
- An enhancement of the On Track Metrics project, this project introduces a badging system to assign badges to students based on their monthly engagement levels.

#### *Approach*:

- The model evaluates student engagement for the month and assigns badges according to their engagement levels.
#### *Tools Used*:
- SQL
- Python
- Clustering Algorithm (KMeans)
- PowerBI for reporting
